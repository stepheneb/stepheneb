[Art & Logic](https://stepheneb.github.io/artandlogic.html): recent consulting projects.

[Resume](https://stepheneb.github.io/resume.html) that's probably way too long.

A longer (and older) [About](https://stepheneb.github.io/) page.

Occasionally I write articles at [learnmaketeachshare.org](https://learnmaketeachshare.org). Here are five I think are especially worth sharing.

1. [Learning something new can make all the difference](https://learnmaketeachshare.org/education/2018/11/09/learning-something-new.html) _(learning)_.
2. [Imagining what could be](https://learnmaketeachshare.org/creating%20with%20software/2018/09/15/imagining-what-could-be.html) _(programming)_.
3. [A hybrid guitar-dulcimer-mandolin](https://learnmaketeachshare.org/making%20instruments/2018/09/30/dinalin.html) _(experimental luthiery)_.
4. [Making nose strips for people sewing masks](https://learnmaketeachshare.org/better%20masks/2020/04/21/making-nose-strips.for-people-sewing-masks.html) _(gave away over 29,000 in five months)_.
5. [Shiitake inoculation parties](https://learnmaketeachshare.org/growing%20mushrooms/2018/08/27/shiitake-inocoluation-parties.html) _(learning together)_.

> _**Note**: recent projects using Java and Rails are in private repositories.
See [Art & Logic](https://stepheneb.github.io/artandlogic.html) for descriptions
and screenshots. Also there are some very large older Rails codebases that are
not showing up here because the repositories appear to have been deleted._
