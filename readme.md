A longer [About](https://stepheneb.github.io/) page.

[Resume](https://stepheneb.github.io/resume.html) that's probably way too long.

- [Imagining what could be](https://learnmaketeachshare.org/creating%20with%20software/2018/09/15/imagining-what-could-be.html) _(programming)_.
- [A hybrid guitar-dulcimer-mandolin](https://learnmaketeachshare.org/making%20instruments/2018/09/30/dinalin.html) _(experimental luthiery)_.
